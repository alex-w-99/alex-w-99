# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm cofounder and CTO of [Vectorly](https://www.vectorly.app), where we're building AI agents to automate healthcare admin and improve patient engagement. Before that, I worked on clinical AI models and helped build a virtual cardiology clinic at [Empallo](https://www.empallo.com), and worked on computer networking research at Northeastern's [Mon(IoT)r Lab](https://moniotrlab.khoury.northeastern.edu). I studied at Northeastern University, earning an MS in computer science and a BS in mathematics and economics.
